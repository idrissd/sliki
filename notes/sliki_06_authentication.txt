Database Authenticatable: encrypts and stores a password in the database to validate the authenticity of a user while signing in. The authentication can be done both through POST requests or HTTP Basic Authentication.
Token Authenticatable: signs in a user based on an authentication token (also known as "single access token"). The token can be given both through query string or HTTP Basic Authentication.
Omniauthable: adds Omniauth (https://github.com/intridea/omniauth) support;
Confirmable: sends emails with confirmation instructions and verifies whether an account is already confirmed during sign in.
Recoverable: resets the user password and sends reset instructions.
Registerable: handles signing up users through a registration process, also allowing them to edit and destroy their account.
Rememberable: manages generating and clearing a token for remembering the user from a saved cookie.
Trackable: tracks sign in count, timestamps and IP address.
Timeoutable: expires sessions that have no activity in a specified period of time.
Validatable: provides validations of email and password. It's optional and can be customized, so you're able to define your own validations.
Lockable: locks an account after a specified number of failed sign-in attempts. Can unlock via email or after a specified time period.
