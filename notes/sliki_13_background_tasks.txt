o install redi and launch
brew install redis
redis-server /usr/local/etc/redis.conf

If this is your first install, automatically load on login with:
    mkdir -p ~/Library/LaunchAgents
    cp /usr/local/Cellar/redis/2.4.16/homebrew.mxcl.redis.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents/
    launchctl load -w ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.redis.plist

If this is an upgrade and you already have the homebrew.mxcl.redis.plist loaded:
    launchctl unload -w ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.redis.plist
    cp /usr/local/Cellar/redis/2.4.16/homebrew.mxcl.redis.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents/
    launchctl load -w ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.redis.plist

  To start redis manually:
    redis-server /usr/local/etc/redis.conf

  To access the server:
    redis-cli
